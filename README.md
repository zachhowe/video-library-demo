# VideoLibrary

VideoLibrary is a demo application for visionOS which depicts a very simple video player with a 3D sphere overlayed on 
top that when interacted with will move at a particular angle across the window. It will bounce off the inner edges of
the window to create a bouncy ball effect.

Video assets used are identical to the Video assets found in Apple Sample Code app [DestinationVideo](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/destination-video).
